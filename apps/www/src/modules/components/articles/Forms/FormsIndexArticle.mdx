## Forms

This is the top-most article for <tt>Forms</tt>. Please use the navigation controls to learn more about components

### Render Interoperability

Certain classes of form controls are interchangeable with respect to the rendered component. This is possible becase the underlying data structures for _value tracking_ and _options domain_ are generic.

For example, an **N_pick_K** use case uses a `Map<{[K: string]: any}>` structure for _value tracking_ and an interface `Array<{ id: string, [K: string]: any}>` for the _options domain_.

This allows the `CheckboxBank`, and the `Select` <tt>FormControl</tt>s to be interchangeable:

<SimpleCheckboxBankExample noDebug />

_or_

<SimpleSelectExample noDebug />

These could even be combined to control the _SAME_ chunk of form state...

### Form Structure

here's an example:

<FormStructureExample />
