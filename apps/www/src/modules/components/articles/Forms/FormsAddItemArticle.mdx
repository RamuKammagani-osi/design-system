Add Item pattern Example

<AddItemExample />

Add New item:
When a new data set may be added to a form, a text button should allow the user to add
extra date fields.

Each time new fieds are added, an "x" appears to the right of the fuelds that are associated with
new values such that new data fields may be removed.
